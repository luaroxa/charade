*If I can play music with the timer that'd be bonus
*will need a library of vocabs -> random generate

I want to make a chrade game.
A player can pick a main topic (I will have 3?)
Then choose a card.
Each card will have 3 words with difficulty of 1 , 2, 3,
they click on the word of choice.
a timer will pop up (difficulty, time): [1, 30] [2, 45] [3,60]
Alert 'times up' message when time is up.
